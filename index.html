        Pala Produce: Our Story
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Pala Produce is a fledgling Far North farm. We — Emma and Aaron McLean —
        sowed the first seeds and started planting trees at the end of 2021.
        Emma has 25 years experience in natural health with a passion for
        nutrition; and Aaron has spent his life immersed in food, first in
        restaurants and then as a food photographer and publisher with a passion
        for growing and local food systems.

        Our Mission: Regenerating the Land
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Our long term focus is on Syntropic Agroforestry, meaning ‘the path of
        life’ - we are regenerating the land we inhabit through natural
        succession, nurturing more and more life to generate increased
        biodiversity and abundance, in the form of a productive multi-strata
        food forest which will leave a native forest in its wake.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In the space between our young fruit tree rows, we have been busy
        preparing the soil to grow nutritious delicious more-than-organic
        veggies for our community.
      </p>

        Our commitment to More-Than-Organic Practices
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        More than organic? Predominantly heirloom and organic seed. No
        pesticides. No fungicides. No synthetic fertilisers. We are too young to
        be certified organic, but we guarantee we use only regenerative organic
        practices and certified organic inputs.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        We believe that if you know your farmer, you know your food, and we’d
        love to know those who eat what we grow, so, with the help of our friend
        and collaborator Dylan Forde, we are establishing a seasonal CSA veggie
        box subscription, starting this December.

        What is CSA? Community Supported Agriculture
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture, a relationship between
        people who care how and where their food is grown, and people like us
        who love to grow it. This connection between us and a small committed
        group of customers means we can welcome visits to the farm, which
        enables you, our community, to verify that we are practising what we
        preach.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        By making a financial commitment to a seasonal subscription, not only do
        you receive a weekly share of what we grow, you help make our dream of
        growing food in this way viable, and you also enable us to care for the
        rest of our diverse little farm; including the retirement and native
        restoration of the stream valley which runs through the land and is
        already home to kiwi, weka and a small patch of established bush.

        Seasonal Subscriptions and Payment Options
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Being a CSA shareholder is a commitment to the full growing season. We
        will be starting with three CSA seasons in a year - December-February,
        March-May, June-August, with a break late winter into spring to prepare
        for the seasons ahead.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In a traditional CSA you would ‘pay up front’ for a share of what the
        farm produces, helping us with our expenses for the season ahead - this
        is our preferred model. However we understand that not everybody has the
        money to pay for food in advance—and we want our food to be
        accessible—so you’re also welcome to ‘pay as you go’. We also encourage
        anybody who wants to ‘pay it forward’ to somebody who they think would
        benefit from a weekly dose of healthy local food. If you’re away during
        the season you’re welcome to gift your share to a friend.
      </p>

        What to Expect in Your Veggie Box
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Each box comes with a delicious diverse seasonal salad mix and a
        selection of other vegetables. It is important to remember that this is
        small-scale hands on production, a veggie box from us will have old
        favorites mixed with new flavors you’ll be excited to discover, but
        we’re not aspiring to the perfect pumpkin or exactly the same veggies
        each week, so we ask you to embrace the adventure, to relish in our
        successes as well as the odd crooked carrot.

        Flavor and Nutrition: The Soil Connection
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Did you know that flavor is an indication of nutrition and a result of
        growing plants in healthy living soil? By nurturing our soil, our soil
        nurtures our plants, and we get to offer you delicious nutrient dense
        food. Not only that, we’re all passionate cooks, so we’re excited to
        grow varieties not available in the supermarket or even at the farmers
        market, and we look forward to sharing information, recipes, and tips
        for how to cook and enjoy our produce.

      <h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-medium text-stone-900">Price and Pickup</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Our veggie boxes will be $40pw, $35 if you pay for the season up front.
        We would love you to pick up from the farm, but we are 10 minutes from
        Kerikeri, so will also enable pickups once a week from a location to be
        confirmed in town. We will only be offering 15 boxes to start while we
        find our feet, so get in touch quickly to secure a spot.
